# Sentiment-Analysis

The expansive IMDB movie review dataset contains a plethora of both positive and negative reviews encompassing various movies. You can access the dataset through this link (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Ensure to peruse the README file accompanying it, as it furnishes an overview of the dataset. Utilize the allocated training and testing data to develop your network. Primarily, engage in data preprocessing to ready the information for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Subsequently, construct a network capable of categorizing reviews as either positive or negative.

Here are the instructions:

1. Assume the dataset is stored in a directory named 'data,' within a folder labeled 'aclImdb,' mirroring the structure of your download. Please refrain from uploading it, following the depiction in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

2. Save your model under the name 'YOUR_ID_NLP_model' within your models directory. You have the liberty to choose any preferred format since you'll handle the loading in your test file.

3. Generate a comprehensive report delineating all preprocessing stages, elucidating the design strategies for your network, documenting training and testing accuracies, and appending any observations regarding the output.

It's crucial to craft your approach independently, drawing insights from available online resources without resorting to code replication. Avoid leveraging pre-trained networks or existing models, as plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will be addressed accordingly. It's pivotal that your report comprehensively justifies and supports all preprocessing measures and network design decisions.
